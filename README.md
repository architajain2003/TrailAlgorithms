The Pathfinder website is an interactive platform designed to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. Users can generate random mazes, set checkpoints, and observe how different algorithms solve the maze in real-time. This project serves as both an educational tool and a demonstration of web development and algorithmic skills.

## Features

- Pathfinding Visualizer: Watch as algorithms navigate through a maze to find the optimal path.
- Random Maze Creation: Instantly generate random mazes for a unique challenge each time.
- Checkpoints: Add checkpoints within the maze to test the algorithms' handling of multi-goal paths.


## Implemented Algorithms

- Dijkstra: Guarantees the shortest path from start to finish by exploring all possible routes.
- A* (A-Star): Combines heuristics with pathfinding to quickly find the optimal path, widely used in AI and games.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all possible paths layer by layer, ideal for unweighted grids.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Dives deep into paths, exploring as far as possible before backtracking, useful in certain scenarios.
